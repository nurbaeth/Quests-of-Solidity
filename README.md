# Quests-of-Solidity
"Quests of Solidity" is an on-chain adventure game where players progress through a series of quests by solving logic-based challenges. Each quest is a smart contract level with its own unique rules and state. No frontend needed â€” all actions happen on-chain through function calls. Designed to showcase Solidity skills in a fun and gamified format.
