# 🧩 Quests of Solidity      
     
**Quests of Solidity** is an on-chain puzzle game where each quest is a smart contract level.     
Players must solve logic-based challenges by submitting correct answers directly on-chain.  
        
No frontend. No rewards. Just pure Solidity brainwork.

## 🎮 Gameplay  
    
1. Call `getCurrentQuest()` to get the quest description.    
2. Think. Solve the puzzle.   
3. Call `submitAnswer("yourAnswer")`.    
4. If correct → next quest unlocked.   
5. If wrong → try again.   
     
Your progress is stored on-chain.
